`Iterator` is a thing in Rust that allows you to... well, iterate over things.
It can be very useful to write compact and optimal code.

For example
```rust
let a: Vec<u32> = (1..1024).collect();
let b = a.iter()
  .map(|&x| x*x)
  .take(5)
  .collect();
// b == vec![1, 4, 9, 16, 25]);
```
this code guarantees you it does only two exact allocations:
  * one allocation of 1023 `u32`s for `a`
  * one allocation of 5 `u32`s for `b`

In contrast in this code
```rust
let mut a = Vec::with_capacity(1023);
for i in 1..1024 {
  a.push(i);
}

let mut b = Vec::with_capacity(5);
for i in 0..5 {
  let x = a[i] * a[i];
  b.push(x);
}
```
  * even though `push()` should not re-allocate the `Vec`s, it always checks if
there is some space left
  * `a[i]` always checks if the given index is not
out of bounds

Plus it is longer and a bit less readable (at least for me)

So, what does it take to implement an iterator?

Not so much I would say - the only required method is `next()`
A very simple iterator, that returns values of fibonacci sequence would look like this

```rust
struct FibIter {
  x: [u32; 2],
}

impl FibIter {
  fn new() -> Self {
    Self{ x: [1, 1] }
  }
}

impl Iterator for FibIter {
  type Item = u32;

  fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
    let ret = self.x[0];
    self.x[0] = self.x[1];
    self.x[1] = ret.wrapping_add(self.x[0]);
    return Some(ret);
  }
}
```
And thats it! Now it can be used like this

```rust
for x in FibIter::new().take(5) {
  println!("{}", x);
}

let x = FibIter::new()
  .skip(5)
  .take(6)
  .collect();
```

But there is one caveat: even though `next()` is so implemented that it always
returns `Some()`, computers are ~~stupid~~ *of limited intelligence* and rely on 
`size_hint` functions when pre-allocating memory inside `collect()` method

So, this should fix it, right?
```rust
impl Iterator for FibIter {
  // ...
  fn size_hint(&self) -> (usize, Option<usize>) {
    (usize::MAX, None)
  }
}
```
`FibIter` now reports that user should expect `usize::MAX` or more elements,
so in the case `.take(6).collect()`, `Vec` should be pre-allocated to fit six
elements and then the collection proccess should happen without `reserve()`ing
additional space. This would help unrolling/vectorizing the loop, because `reserve()`
checks if it can expand memory (if it can't, it just `panic!()`s).

But [godbolt](https://godbolt.org) says that the `reserve()` is still there in loop
(in form of `__rust_realloc` and `__rust_alloc`)
```asm

Is [`ExactSizeIterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/iter/trait.ExactSizeIterator.html)
the answer here?

No.

ummm.. maybe it will work with
[`FusedIterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/iter/trait.FusedIterator.html)?

No.

Turns out that value from `size_hint` can't be trusted.
For example a programmer could leave a default implementation of it
```rust
fn size_hint(&self) -> (usize, Option<usize>) {
  (0, None)
}
```
which is correct for every iterator, but is not precise.
More so, because implementation of it could return random value and because of 
"safe code must be safe" rule, it can't be used to build a vector safely from 
it without additional checks.

However, there is still hope -
[`TrustedLen`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/iter/trait.TrustedLen.html)

`TrustedLen` is an `unsafe` trait, but `unsafe` doesn't mean it will
[erase hard drive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18506029/can-undefined-behavior-erase-the-hard-drive)
(although it can), `unsafe` often means that the compiler can't prove if the
code is correct, so programmer has to do it instead.

I am sure that implementation is correct,
```rust
#![feature(trusted_len)]

struct FibIter {
  x: [u32; 2],
}

impl FibIter {
  fn new() -> Self {
    Self{ x: [1u32; 2] }
  }
}

impl Iterator for FibIter {
  type Item = u32;
  
  fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
    let ret = self.x[0];
    self.x[0] = self.x[1];
    self.x[1] = ret.wrapping_add(self.x[0]);
    return Some(ret);
  }
  
  fn size_hint(&self) -> (usize, Option<usize>) {
    (usize::MAX, None)
  }
}

use std::iter::{
    FusedIterator,
    ExactSizeIterator,
    TrustedLen,
};

impl FusedIterator for FibIter {}
impl ExactSizeIterator for FibIter {}
unsafe impl TrustedLen for FibIter {}
```

however, *the proof of correctness of this code is trivial and left for reader as an exercise.*

Now the loop of this function
```rust
pub fn collect_fib(n: usize) -> Vec<u32> {
  FibIter::new().take(n).collect()
}
```
looks like this
```asm
.LBB3_11:
        mov     dword ptr [rsi], edi
        add     edi, ebx
        mov     dword ptr [rsi + 4], ebx
        add     ebx, edi
        mov     dword ptr [rsi + 8], edi
        add     edi, ebx
        mov     dword ptr [rsi + 12], ebx
        add     ebx, edi
        mov     dword ptr [rsi + 16], edi
        add     edi, ebx
        mov     dword ptr [rsi + 20], ebx
        add     ebx, edi
        mov     dword ptr [rsi + 24], edi
        add     edi, ebx
        mov     dword ptr [rsi + 28], ebx
        add     ebx, edi
        add     rsi, 32
        add     rax, 8
        jne     .LBB3_11
```
No `reserve()`, no additional checks, loop unrolling, pure beauty!
It has only one drawback - it compiles only on nightly compiler because of
`trusted_len` feature
